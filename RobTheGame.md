## Objectives/How To Play (More Information In-Game)
Your goal is to collect letters when they appear using your lasso, then using those letters to spell enough words and earn enough points to pass the level. Each level will display the requirements during the level select screen.  
  
To collect letters, drag your mouse in the direction that a letter appears and left click. Your lasso will shoot out to grab the letter.  
  
Once you collect the letter, it will appear in your inventory on the right.  

To spell a word, you can type the word on your keyboard or click on each letter in order of the word you want to spell. Selected letters will turn green. Press enter to submit your word.

You can deselect letters by clicking on them. They should turn from green back to their original white.
