      "desc":"In chemistry, one of the major assignemnts we had to do is lab assignments involved with PhET simulations. In this particular one, we had to explore and control a lunar lander and experience the percise controls needed to be able to land and move the lunar lander. For this, we had to write many observations in the google form. I personally haven't done anything of sorts before so this had been a new experience for me. Before the simulation, I didn't know how percise you had to be with the lunar lander when trying to place it on the moon. Afterwords, I recognize how hard it was to overall control it."
