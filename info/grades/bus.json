I had been quite enthusiastic about it, and it had been one of the major projects of the year and one of the ones that I believe most satisfied me with the outcome. This project specifically involves a lengthy process of research, scouting, and designing. I had to first research about aspects of my choice of business (organic grocery store) and gather data to write a report on how my business would operate. Next, I had to scout places and empty lots where my business will operate, and log down my expenses to how much I would have to spend to try to convince the teacher (Mr.Lobrace) to invest in my business. Once I compiled all the information in a report, I was shocked to see how much I am losing in the first year and saw how hard it is to make any profit as a new business. I have never done anything of sorts in the past, and it is quite a unique experience. One major thing I like about this work is that it goes into specific details and plans that I actually envisioned if I was running an actual company. The report had been quite lengthy, and I am satisfied with the information I was able to fit. The major thing I dislike is the logo and advertisement design. I am not a proficient graphic designer and I have fell flat making the final product look slightly unprofessional. If I could change anything about it if I restarted it, that would be it. I would put much more time into it than I had.",
