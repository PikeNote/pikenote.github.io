      "desc":"This year in Geometry, this topic has been completely new to me. The class moved at a much higher pace than I expected. Some assignments done in this class involves worksheets that are given at the beginning. The class would go over them as a whole. Through virtual learning, a whiteboard is there to help show work and help guide, which had been super helpful rather than just lecture. I overall had learned quite a bit in the class and there is not much to say. This was a new subject for me and isn't a refresher like last year."
