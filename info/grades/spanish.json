      "desc":"One of the more interesting projects that I had done is a Spanish vlogging project. This is quite a new experience for me as I usually do not do any sort of project like this in day to day life. I had to relearn how to edit and properly record an exciting vlog. This had been one of the harder projects to do because I could not do some of the tasks that were listed, like cooking food. I had to very much get creative with it and took an idea to origami which I succeeded, and I was happy with how those turned out. During the course of multiple vlogs, I had to plan out what I was going to say as to not need a retake. Editing took a while as to get the effects right and try to make the vlog exciting as it was a bit dull. If I had to go back and restart it, I would definitely figure out new ways to make the vlog more interesting as my vlog had been quite lacking compared to the others.",
