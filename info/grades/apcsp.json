      "desc":"Right before the AP create task assignment for AP computer science this year, this had been one of the major assignments. This mini project of sorts is to prepare what it is like coding the actual create task. One of the major challenges/steps to create this is to think of a program that would fit all major criteria of the create task in general. The program had to first have a procedure, loop, sequencing, etc. The goal of this app is to measure the typing speed of the user and give the user a random list of words for a typing test to improve it over time. What I really liked about this project is how it is well documented code wise and how the code works well. One thing I dislike would be the fact that this program is very simple and cannot do a lot of things like grabbing an actual sentence for the user to type. Due to time constraints, I was not able to further expand out on it. If I would to do this again with more time, that would be the first thing I would begin to change.",
