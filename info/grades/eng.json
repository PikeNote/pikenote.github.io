    "desc":"Me and my partner first had to compile a list of words that represent or mean something in the text. This was then inputted into wordart.com for a creation of a word cloud of sorts. A wine picture is used her for the purpose of representing what was talked about in the text. This piece of work is quite simple and I don't believe it is much. One of the major issues I didn't like with this work is the time constraint and how little worsds I am able to fit in. It makes the word cloud very bare. I liked the idea of the overall shape along with the explanaitions of some of the words and the deeper meanings. If other people looked at my work, I think the main thing I want them to notice would be the creativity using the piece of wine art to symbolize something from the story. One thing I would like to imprve upon is to add a wide variety of words to the cloud along with explaiations to make this more intersting to look at and read about.",
