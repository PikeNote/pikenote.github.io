      "desc":"Learning about the Zouaves in the civil war, one of the assignments is to make a recruitment poster. One of the major sources that were useful to contribute to this project is using references from actual recruitment posters from the time. From that idea, you can get how much soldiers were paid and what bonuses or extras were given. Personally, I like this piece of work because of the research that went to it and reference real life people. One major thing I dislike is the design, since the poster felt a bit empty or off to me. If I were a teacher grading this, I may give not grade it as high because it contains not as much information. I had aimed for more design and making it look a bit closer to what was there before rather than trying to squeeze awkward facts on. One goal for myself next time is to consult others to help identify what I am doing design wise and ask and clarify more what is expected from me by teachers.",
