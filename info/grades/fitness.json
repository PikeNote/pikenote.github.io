      "desc":"This year had been quite a mild year for gym, health, and dance appreciation. Not exactly much happened that many simple assignments given to help teach me about exercises in health. I was able to learn about different types of exercises and what they can do for you. I was also able to plan a workout schedule for myself, so I can reach set fitness goals that I wanted for myself. In dance appreciation, I was able to read and study up on a bunch of different dance moves, origins, and choreography. Google form assignments were given every week and I had found them semi-interesting. I look forward to what comes next year as everyone would be in-person and more fun activities would come out of it. This year had been quite challenging and I believe the teachers did the best they could for the scenario."
