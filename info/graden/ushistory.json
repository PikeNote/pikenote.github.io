    "desc":"The Harlem Renaissance presentation project was one of the most difficult projects that I had worked on. This presentation had us analyze the song of Harlem Renaissance singers, and then present about their past, their history, and how they connect to each other. For the person that I had gotten, Lena Horne, I had to get creative with the prompt itself. She had no particular messages in her songs and she was one of the exceptions that stray from the rest of singers who talk about topics such as civil rights, which the goal of the project was to highlight these points. This was one of the projects I had more or less broken away from the prompt and had to work a bit more creatively. I dove into her past, her connections with organizations, to draw conclusions such as she was a poster child of the equal rights movement and signed under labels and thus won't have many controversal songs herself. It was the most in depth I had gone before for a project of such a calibar, and I was quote proud of it at the end. At the beginning of all of this, I thought it was imposible and asked for assistance left and right. I had almost given up but I persevered thinking I think I could do something with this topic. This perseverence got me through, and me and my teacher was quite proud of what I had created.",
