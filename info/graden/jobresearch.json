    "desc":"After the Naviance application survey, the personality I had got was ISTP (Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, and Percieving). I had been expecting the result of sorts and had been what I had expected. Throughout my life, I had been keeping to myself and I had been critical thinking. I act more and are willing to help others when they need it. One of the jobs suggested had been a web developer. This fits my Computer Science agenda, and I had a dream to get into computer science. I plan to pursue many of the careers when I do grow up. This survey had also made me realized some other jobs I could choose like being a Computer Network Architect. From the beginning, I had wanted to go into a more coding focused path and this had allowed me to considered other options.",
