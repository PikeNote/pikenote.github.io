However, Spanish III had a large focus on this time around on other cultures! Besides learning Spanish, I had to research and give presentations on it. This project was about Tierra del Fuego, an archepeligo in South America that is a popular tourist destination. We were to talk about its vast history like the Yaghan people who lived there and many tales and stories that came along with it. It was one of the funner projects that I had worked in that class, and the slides were very minimal to allow for maximum Spanish speaking. Though the presentational aspect as my Spanish isn't too fluent wasn't the best, I strived to improve it down the line.",
