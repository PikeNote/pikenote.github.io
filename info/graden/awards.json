    "desc":"One of the first competitions I had ever done is the Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) computing applications test. This test encompassed a wide range of computing knowledge like operating systems and system specifications. The test was quite hard to study for with how wide the subject was but I had extra class time in Computer Applications in Business to study for it. The final result of the competition is landing in 4th place of the regionals which had been quite impressive to me seeing how many people were testing and the fact that there were very few freshman. One of the freshman I knew had scored 1st place and I was very impressed. This had really shown be I needed to study more, but I had overall qualified for the state competition. If I land somewhere in the top 3, I could have a chance to go to the nationwide competition which would be amazing."
