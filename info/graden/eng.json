    "desc":"One of the projects I had done in English, and really the only one is the pillow book. The goal is to write a piece of literature like the actual pillow book onto a poster like format. The pillow book is a piece of literature written by Sei Shōnagon in the year 1000, with observations. Within the book, Sei had listed many things that had pleased her, or had disgusted her. Some of the criteria with the project is that many of the topics we had to list we had to describe in detail along with the fact that the pillow book had to be colorful. With those criteria in mind, I wrote my descriptions in a poetic tone to try to imitate how the original pillow book was written. This project was overall opinionated and didn’t require much research though the pictures had to be credited. One major issue with this project is the spacing of the items and text. When I started designing the pillow book, I had underestimated the scale of the poster itself when printed, and so I had made many poor font size and spacing choices. What I had learned from that is that I had to check the print preview to see how big it really is, and use that information as a rough estimate of how it would look like if it was printed out.",
