    "desc":"One of the activities I did in my gym class early on in the year was project adventure. Inside, there were many activities that were designed to help everyone to get to know everyone else. Project adventure or PA had forced everyone, including me, have a trust in each other, and work with each other to solve a specific problem. One nice thing about project adventure is how one can choose if they want to do such activity. Of course, one would still need to do something but you aren’t forced into uncomfortable situations or activity. One activity I had done in project adventure is the wooden stool rope swing. This activity involved people having to swing over to a small wooden platform where 12 people had to be standing at all times and only when the 13th person swing over can someone step off onto a plate down. This activity required the class to come together and do some planning after many failures, and give instructions what people should do. Everyone had listened to each other and had trusted everyone else. For me, project adventure had allowed me to break out from my quiet introvert self, as normally in middle school, I had never had such an opportunity/experience to do these kind of activities. Even though I didn’t really liked physical education beforehand, I had fun trying new activities like flying squirrel and tire swinging. In the end, I trusted everyone more and learned everyone’s names and so project adventure had achieved its goal."
