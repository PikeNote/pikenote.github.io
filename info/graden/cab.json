    "desc":"One CAB project I had done is a timeline of the operating system. This project excited me as I really liked technology and interacting with it. The project gave me an opportunity to dive into the past, and see what people were using back then, and the transition into the modern era. One of the major issues with the project is with many different versions of the operating systems, for example Windows 7,8,10 or MacOS Catalina, Mountain Lion, etc. These operating systems were harder to put in, as my group had to make some sort of criteria to put them in, and they had to be major changes from each other. After I had done some digging into the subject itself, I had found out many of the early operating system used command lines. I surprised myself, and I always wondered how people could use those. More importantly however, I had watched the transition of the operating system from the simple little command lines to actual graphical interface which came first in the form of a Mac. MacOS was the first stepping stone, for setting the bar for what an actual user friendly OS should feel and look like. Many operating systems after that followed suit, as Microsoft had released Windows Vista. One of the OS that I believe would set the future would be the Linux OS or rather all of its distributions. The Linux operating system is wonderful due to how open source it is, and I believe that is what would take us to the future.",
