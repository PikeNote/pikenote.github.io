The process to get through the certification was quite long as there were many proper tecniques and methods that one has to learnn to do proper CPR. We were trained on training dummies including how to use AED devices. When I started the class, I was quite nervous with my form and how I was performing CPR as I was not confident. There were many specifics in doing CPR and hwo to treat certain injuries that I had to pick up on through the videos and the book. Despite this, I felt proud that I was able to pass and get the certification. I was happy that I had the ability to help those around me when they are in critical condition, and having the knowledge and the know-how is something I keep dear to.
