    "desc": "One of the projects that I had done in the capstone course had been the first mock individual research reports and the group presentation. This was the first time I had any experience with capstone, and this was one of the most difficult processes. When looking into a research topic, my group had jumped around a few different subjects. We were thinking about environmental topics related to pollution to data collection by big companies. Once we divided up the task, we had realized that there was not much data on what we were researching for. At this point, we were 1 week in and we changed our topic. This caused the rest of our project to be much further behind than the other groups. We were working and practicing our presentation up even until the last second. To help overcome that challenge, my group had pushed for more progress in a shorter amount of time to recover lost time. We had met more frequently and decided to share as much sources with each other to make our lives earlier. We also had to adapt further by thinking already ahead about the project so we know exactly what to cover and what to start off with in the middle of writing our research reports. I learned that I can be very dedicated and productive when committed to a task in a proper environment. Also I did learn how well I can plan and coordinate a team, as I had planned out what we are doing and combined the information from our team. Overall in life, I have learned that nothing may go as planned. It is to push forward and deal with the challenge, even if the task at hand is completely new to you.",
