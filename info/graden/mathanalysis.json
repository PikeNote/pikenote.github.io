    "desc": "Math analysis was one of the most interesting math classes I've ever had. Lessons in this classes were wholely based on presentations and it was mainnly students teaching each other. Every marking period, every student has to go once and the student reads ahead to be able to demonstrate the concept to their classmates after. This kind of learning is unique, with peers putting lessons in more understandable terms.  Through this model, I had a much easier time picking up pre-calculus concepts. When I had to do mo round of preesntations, I aimed to break it down with lower level concepts/infrences. Before the presentation, I had to prepare in advance what I am going to say loosely and what problems I am going over. This helped me be more confident in the presentations, though I wish I planned a bit more with how I wrote on the board.  One problem I noticed was how my problems written when presenting aren't as organized as I hoped them to be and it may have caused confusion. Getting participation was another subject, as I struggled to weave questions and encourage people to answer in-betweenn. Overall my time in math analysis has been enjoyable, and is something I will keep in mind going into the future when I help others with certain concepts."
