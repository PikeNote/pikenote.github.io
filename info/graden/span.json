    "desc":"In Spanish, one of the projects I had done is the self-introduction project. The goal is to in Spanish introduce oneself using Spanish adjectives and sentences we had learned in class. Personally, the final project looked very plain and very minimal. I could have improved many parts of it lie the design background, and the sentences themselves. One person with the project on presentation day has to present the project to a group of people. Many just read off their paper, and the teacher grades for accuracy and grammar within the text. Personally, I didn’t have too much fun doing the project, and it seemed more like a burden to do it. This I believe comes from my distaste for the class. I feel like I could’ve put more effort into the project tom make it look nicer, and personally I feel like the project looks rushed. Within the project, I had described who I am as a person, my traits, my hobbies, etc. One thing is my grammar, and Iat that time I didn’t have a full grasp on the subject and so it wasn’t written to the best of my ability.",
