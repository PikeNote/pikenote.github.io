    "desc": "Physics in my junior year had been a difficult subject due to the rigirous curriculum. One of the highlights of that class had been the catapult project to study projectile motion. The proejct revolved arounnd constructing a catapult to learn about projectile motion, and take measures of projectile time and verify it with equations. As with many projects involving some building, it did not go smoothly as expected.  For this project, for the first time, I had used CAD software to model out out the catapult and the measurements to ensure everything will work out. One of the biggest hurdals that we had to overcome for this part of the project is the catapult mounting.  We did not have access to major tools and thus had to improvise using bungee hooks to suspend the arm. This had been one of my biggest regrets for this project, as further planning/budgeting of time helps remove that crnuch and allow proper setups to be installed. In the end, the catapult did work but at a limited ability. At the end tho, constructing and modeling it was quite fun, and I hope to plan much better and ahead with a more simple design to hopefully have a more successful time."
