    "desc":"One of the certifications I had completed at UCVTS is the IC3 certification. This included lessons about ettique online, computing fundamentals, and how to use software like microsoft word or excel. This certification I didn't have much trouble with as I already had prerequisite knowledge about the subject. While certifying, there were many videos and little quizzes at the end of each lesson. I had went through all of them with mostly a breeze. The course that I had learned the most in is when being trained about microsoft word/excel. This is mainly due to the fact that I had never used them personally, and it was something new. The courses themselves were informative and went through different subjects. By far, I had been the most worried for the microsoft excel/word certification as it was a new piece of software I had never used before. Besides this however, I had managed to finish this very early along with few other people. After I finished, many people in my class had some trouble with subjects and I had tried explaining and showing them examples. One thing I had noticed while going through the course is how buggy sometimes the software is, and I had wished for that to hopefully be fixed sometime.",
