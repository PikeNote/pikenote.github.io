    "desc":"Over the course of 8th grade and into the summer, I had attended Real World Connections (NJIT) leadership courses. The goals of these courses is to learn how to successfully lead a team, and organize them. RWC is a program where one learns real world skills like programming or film making from colledge students who study the course. The program aims as a learning experience for students and a substitute for the capstone program. During the course, I had learned how to fully work as a team, presenting professionally, and opening up. One major event is an Google staff member who had originally attended the program came in and talked to the students about leadership. Professors also came in to talk and in a open-type manner discuss topics and for us to converse and learn something form the experience. This certification had allowed me to help as an assitant coach over the summer and in the fall semester in my freshman year. This is currently a yellow belt certificate and I need to attend a second time to fully qualify.",
