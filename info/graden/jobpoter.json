    "desc":"One of the careers I had picked out that seemed interesting to me is being a Software Developer. This is a career that I had heavily researched into, including much of the work environments and requirements. The job seemed most interesting to me due to the fact that I myself want to major in the computer science field in the future. Many figures like the growing number of jobs had allowed me to say that the job was in high demand. I myself, would want to of course help direct a team and to make a final product that seems good in the consumerâ€™s hand. Throughout my coding experience, I had always made stuff for others, and never much for myself. I want to give others the tool and it brings me satisfaction that they are happy with a tool that simplifies their lives. I always like to innovate, and having a team to discuss and plan out these ideas is something extremely exciting for me. I always like to share new methods and ideas of doing certain things, and improve on them. The poster/advertisement is a way to get familiar with what I wanted to do. Along with that, I had put many inspirational quotes at the bottom from many great programmers who major in the same field. They give some words of encouragement, and help entice people into this ever growing field.",
