    "desc":"This year I had combined algebra, and very much it was a refresher from what I’ve learned from 8th grade. Within the class, I had quickly grasped many of the concepts but memorization wise, there were some struggles remembering the little rules. Throughout the class, I had no issue working with others and overall helped go over solutions when others don’t understand something. Many times, there are some disagreements in answers, and there would be little discussions on how one got the answer they did get. Many times, I had sped ahead of the class when the teacher had been going over subjects to try to challenge myself. Of course, I had gone back and gone over many of the answers and made sure I did the correct thing. During tests and quizzes, I had many stumbles and small mistakes that I had made and forgot about some little topics. This causes many mistakes in those assignments, and it mainly boils down to some key components that were forgotten/looked passed like formulas. I would need a lot more work in that department if I wanted to succeed, and with that more studying and reviews. Along with that, the one big downfall I also have is not asking many questions, even if I were confused. I always try to solve the problem by myself, to try to get a better understanding of the subject itself. Algebra had never been much of a problem but the lack of exploring a topic for a long duration of time may allow the topic to become fuzzy."
